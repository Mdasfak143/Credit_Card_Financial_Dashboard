## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive **Credit Card Weekly Dashboard** that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to efficiently monitor and analyze credit card operations, identifying patterns, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement.

## Project Dashboard (Power BI)

The dashboard is developed using **Power BI**, providing a dynamic and interactive interface to visualize data from various credit card operations. It includes the following reports:

### Credit Card Transaction Report

This report aggregates and visualizes all credit card transactions, allowing users to see trends in spending, payment patterns, and other transaction metrics.

- Overview of transaction types (purchases, payments, fees)
- Visual breakdown of total spending by categories (e.g., online shopping, dining, etc.)
- Analysis of high-value transactions
- Time-based filters to view transactions for the selected week

### Credit Card Customer Report

The customer report provides detailed information on individual credit card users, highlighting usage patterns, payment behavior, and customer segmentation.

- Breakdown of active vs. inactive users
- Insights into credit card utilization rate and outstanding balances
- Age, gender, and geographic distribution of customers
- Default rates and payment behavior analysis

## Project Insights

In this section, we present key findings derived from the data analyzed in the dashboard. These insights will help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

- **Transaction Trends:** Analysis shows increasing spending in specific categories such as online shopping and travel, with particular spikes during the holiday season.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Younger demographics are showing more frequent credit card usage, while older demographics tend to maintain lower balances.
- **Payment Behavior:** A significant portion of customers struggle to meet minimum payment requirements, which may indicate the need for financial guidance or early intervention from the institution.

## Final Conclusion

The **Credit Card Financial Dashboard** provides valuable insights into customer behavior and transaction patterns, facilitating better decision-making. By leveraging these real-time metrics, stakeholders can improve credit card operations, enhance customer experiences, and optimize financial strategies.
